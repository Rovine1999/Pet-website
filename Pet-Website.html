        <h2><u>About Dogs</u></h2>
        <p>When humans hear someone speak, our brains divide the work of processing that verbal communication between the left and right hemispheres. First, the right hemisphere focuses on parsing out the speaker's underlying tone, then the left hemisphere processes the meaning of what we've heard.

            Researchers discovered in 2014 that dogs' brains divvy up the task of speech processing in the same way, between their left and right hemispheres, though the scientists weren't sure of the order in which that happened.
